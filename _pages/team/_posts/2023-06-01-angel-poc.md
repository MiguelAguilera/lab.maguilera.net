I am a computer scientist with a keen interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. To advance current solutions, I believe in an interdisciplinary approach to machine learning. This perspective drives my interest in computational neuroscience and statistical physics. Currently, I am applying tools from nonequilibrum statistical mechanics to unravel the mechanisms underlying Transformer neural networks.
