We exploit methods from nonequilibrium statistical physics and the disordered physics of associative memories to describe the macroscopic variables that guide the behavior of attention mechanisms in transformer models. By investigating the relationship between attention mechanisms and associative memories (aka asymmetric Hopfield networks), we aim to uncover the complex dynamics of such networks. Using path integral methods over generating functionals, we derive analytical approximations for large self-attention neural networks, revealing phenomena such as nonequilibrium phase transitions and chaotic bifurcations. This approach enhances the interpretability of transformer models and aims to reduce computational training costs.

### Stochastic Thermodynamics of Autonomous Agents

We are studiyng how to use [stochastic thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_thermodynamics) to formalize the capacities of [autonomous agents](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1059712309343819), particularly their ability to [maintain far-from-equilibrium states](https://www.lehigh.edu/~mhb0/autfuncrep.html) by actively harvesting and storing free energy from their environments. By studying nonequilibrium steady states, we identify conditions under which agents can sustain themselves autonomously, differentiating these from states near thermodynamic equilibrium with low energy-harvesting potential. Additionally, we explore the adaptive mechanisms that allow agents to regulate their interactions with the environment, ensuring the robust maintenance of their nonequilibrium states. This work aims to deepen our understanding of how thermodynamic processes underpin the emergence and persistence of complex, adaptive behavior in natural and artificial systems.
